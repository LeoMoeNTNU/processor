### The addi.s sign extension
For some reason, it fails on test 12. I am not yet sure about why this happens. 
Many of the other tests run very well. 
When I take out that line, the rest of it runs very well and correctly (:-)

sub also doesnt work just yet. 

### It seems like the reason that sub doesnt work is because lui doesn't
